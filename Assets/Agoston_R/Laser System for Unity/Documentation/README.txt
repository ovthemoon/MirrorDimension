Thank you for purchasing Laser System for Unity, I hope it will serve you well in your projects or learning Unity. 

The documentation is publicly available online at https://github.com/agostonr/Laser-system
It contains all the necessary info to know what is what and how to use them.

If you want to run the automated tests yourself, add the package to the "testables" inside your project's manifest file.
